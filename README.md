Very simple custom Express server/middleware for live-reloading. It injects a `type="module"` script tag before `</body>`, and that script just does simple polling to a namespaced (`/dev/`) pseudo-API url to check the last time the source files were modified. The server replies based on a Chokidar file watcher.
